Welcome! I am a Ph.D. student at [Department of Applied Physics, California Institute of Technology](https://aph.caltech.edu/), advised by [Prof. Kerry Vahala](https://vahala.caltech.edu/). I received my B.S. from [School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, China](http://eecs.pku.edu.cn/) in 2022.

Optical frequency combs
------
Optical frequency combs are specialized lasers that act like a ruler for light. In frequency domain, these Nobel Prize-winning devices fill an important technological gap. Optical frequency combs allow scientists to measure and control light waves in the radio-frequency band. With optical frequency combs, technologies that employ microwave frequencies in radio-frequency band — such as atom clocks, communication devices, and computers — are now coherently connected to light waves that oscillate at much higher frequencies in optical band.
